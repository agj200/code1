2. What was a challenge you encountered in creating this submission (be specific)? How did you overcome it? (recommended 200 - 400 words)
   There were no real problems with creating the submission. CodePath delivered the instructions and guide in a clear and straight-forward manner. The only real problem came about from time-management. Currently, I work full time while going to school full time (while also trying to graduate with honors). I would’ve like to complete some CodePath courses this semester, but in the interests of doing everything to the best of my ability I could not. That’s why I’m so glad this summer opportunity has opened.

3. What questions about web development do you have after completing your submission? (recommended 100 - 300 words)
   None specifically pertaining to this project, but it would be interesting to know what websites were noteworthy, from a development perspective. Just in terms of providing examples to practice (in the future - but that may be outside of the course purview).
   What coomputer science curriculum sturture /computer language development path do you feel is ideal for development of skills? Are there skills that schools don’t teach that you feel is vital (or perhaps just important for advanced work)? Besides the basic college computer science requirements are there other areas of study that students should investigate.

4) If you had a few more hours to work on this project, what would you spend them doing (for example: refactoring certain functions, adding additional features, etc). Be specific. (recommended 100 - 300 words)
